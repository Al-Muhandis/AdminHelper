"Group members notify administrators of spam messages themselves using the `/spam` command. \n"
"The command should be sent in response to a spam message.\n"
"All administrators receive a copy of the inspected message with the ability to check whether the member has correctly pointed to the spam message. \n"
"If it is indeed a spam message, the member's rating is increased. \n"
"At a certain number of points, spam messages are automatically deleted without the administrators' approval. \n"
"If the inspected message is incorrectly identified as a spam, the member's rating is downgraded.\n"
"In order for the bot to receive a list of administrators in a group or in case of deleting or adding a new one, it is necessary to send the `/update` command from any of the current administrators.\n"
"Due to the fact that these commands are instantly deleted by the bot itself in the group, reports and updates occur unnoticed by users"
